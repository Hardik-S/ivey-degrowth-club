    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        The Ivey Degrowth Club is a space for critical engagement with sustainable alternatives
        to traditional growth-focused economic models. Our mission is to challenge the
        growth-centric mindset pervasive in conventional business education and practice. By
        exploring themes such as degrowth, environmental limits, and the social consequences
        of unchecked economic expansion, we aim to foster a community of forward-thinking
        individuals who prioritize equity, ecological balance, and meaningful well-being over
        unbounded consumption and profit.

    <p>
        Our activities include hosting open forums, such as discussions on the environmental
        and social impacts of fast fashion, the role of rent extraction in perpetuating inequality,
        and the potential for a frugal abundance mindset to enrich lives while respecting planetary
        boundaries. We also organize interactive events like "Diversity of Thought Week," which
        encourages students to question conventional economic narratives and engage with diverse
        perspectives, including Indigenous knowledge systems and sustainable business models.

    <p>
        Through educational content, workshops, and advocacy, we aim to challenge the status quo.
        The Ivey Degrowth Club believes that addressing issues like the Jevons Paradox, rentier
        capitalism, and the environmental costs of consumerism requires not just incremental change
        but a systemic reevaluation of how we define progress and success.
